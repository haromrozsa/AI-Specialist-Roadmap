Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on
developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience,
or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes
predictions based on that data. Examples include classification and regression tasks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data.
Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment,
receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

Popular applications include image recognition, speech recognition, medical diagnosis,
and recommendation systems.
